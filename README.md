This project sets up a basic Node.js web server that serves multiple HTML pages, including a home page (index.html), 
an about page (about.html), a contact page (contact-me.html), and a 404 error page for unrecognized routes (404.html). 
To get started, ensure you have Node.js installed, then clone the repository or download the files. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and initialize the project with npm init -y.
Start the server by running node index.js, and open your web browser to access the pages at http://localhost:8080 for the home page, http://localhost:8080/about for the about page, 
and http://localhost:8080/contact-me for the contact page. Any other URL will display the 404 error page.
